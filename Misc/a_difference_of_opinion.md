## A Difference of Opinion

### So what gives?

So what is *really* qualifies as an [opinion](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/opinion)? 

It is widely understood as a person's perspective or view on a certain subject that may or may not be factual. It maybe political spiritual or a stance that may be influenced by experience or expertise, or even just whimsical.

>For example, if someone opines that *Vanilla* is the best ice cream flavour in the whole wide world, then how do we treat his/her opinion? 

It is obviously impossible if not difficult to determine, extremely subjective, cannot be verified by any known means but more importantly, is it *acceptable*?

>Why, yes. Absolutely.

### Then what really matters about an opinion?

Opinions driven by biases that do not place people at harm's way, are by and large acceptable. Choosing Vanilla over any other flavour, is a personal choice and an opinion that others are expected to accept without fuss or justification. And it is reasonable too, given its personal nature. When a difference arises, we can respectfully agree to disagree and move on without affecting whatever relationship we share.

### But what about *political* opinions? 

- What about opinions that involve lives of people facing the dehumanising nature of systemic oppression? 
- What about historical opinions about what was and how life should be for a faction of people, who are fighting to have their voices heard? 
- How acceptable is an opinion from a person far removed from the conflict and the perils that ails suffering factions?

It is not uncommon to meet and hear people, often online, having an opinion about how certain population groups should be treated.

 Whether it is Kashmiris, Uigyurs, Rohingyas, Kurds, Dalits, LGBTQ, Tibetans, Chagossians, Blacks, Arab Immigrants, the differently abled to name a few, but really any group that lacks proportional representation and have very little or no say, in their present or future.

We often hear **strong** disparaging opinions by pro-establishment voices, how the **authorities** responsible have done more than enough and often these minorities are busy gaming the system at the expense of the majority. Often such opinions are directed at delegitimising their struggle for basic human rights and absurd acts of oppresion are glossed over as justified reaction to protesting groups.

This phenomenon is not new, history is replete with such accounts. Blacks, Factory Workers, Children, Jews, Indians - you name it, **deserved** less than they *felt* entitled to, until the baseless untenable opinion about their rights *changed* - again not because of some self initiated introspection by the oppressors, but only through relentless struggle for freedom and economic constraints following the Second World War.
